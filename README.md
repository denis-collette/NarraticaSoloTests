# 🧪 Narratica Playground

Welcome to the **Narratica Playground**, a dedicated space for testing and experimenting with different ideas, features, and components related to the [Narratica project](https://github.com/denis-collette/Narratica-MountainProject).

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is meant to:
- Test new frontend components or UI logic before adding them to the main project
